# smart-home-nodeMCU
Smart home automation using NodeMCU (ESP8266) and a 4-channel relay module. Control appliances like fans via a web interface using WiFiManager and AsyncWebServer. No hardcoded credentials—easy setup and local browser control.
I'm excited to share one of my recent hands-on projects — Home Automation using a Web Server, built using the NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller and a 4-channel relay module.
 Project Highlights:
 ➤ Controlled electrical appliances (fans, lights, etc.) wirelessly
 ➤ Created a responsive web interface hosted on the NodeMCU
 ➤ Integrated ESPAsyncWebServer and WiFiManager libraries for asynchronous performance and easy Wi-Fi configuration
 ➤Implemented relay switching logic for up to 4 devices via a mobile or desktop browser
 ➤ Used mDNS for easier access to the local web server (http://relaybox.local)
 ✅ Powered the system using a simple USB charger adapter
Tech Stack:
NodeMCU (ESP8266)
C++ with Arduino IDE
HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for the UI)
Libraries: ESPAsyncWebServer, WiFiManager, mDNS, DNSServer
 What I Learned:
*Working with asynchronous web servers on microcontrollers
*Designing intuitive and responsive control interfaces
*Handling GPIO pins and relay logic safely
*Creating scalable and modular embedded applications

This project helped me better understand the practical applications of IoT in home automation and energy management.
